# 🛡️ My TryHackMe Cybersecurity Journey

Welcome to my hands-on cybersecurity learning portfolio built through the [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com) platform. This repo contains detailed notes, reflections, and practical takeaways from each room I’ve completed.

I’m using this space to track my progress, showcase my applied knowledge, and build a strong foundation toward a cybersecurity internship by 2026.
