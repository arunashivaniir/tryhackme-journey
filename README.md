# 🛡️ My TryHackMe Cybersecurity Journey

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey through [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com) — a platform for practical cybersecurity labs. As a Computer Science student aiming to become a cybersecurity analyst, I'm using this space to showcase what I’ve learned, practiced, and built from each room I complete.
